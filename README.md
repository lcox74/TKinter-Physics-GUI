# TKinter-Physics-GUI
This was my first attempt at using TKinter as the GUI library for python. The program displays a ball to ball collision system which allows you to change the size and colour of the balls. It works well but the collisions get buggy if there are alot of balls on the screen and if the balls are too big.

## Controls
- Left click = Create object
- Right click = Remove object
